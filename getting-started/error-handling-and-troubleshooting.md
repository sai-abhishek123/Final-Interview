# Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### **Error Handling and Troubleshooting**

The **Course Enrollment and Monitoring System** is designed to provide clear and actionable error messages to users while maintaining robust backend validation. This section outlines common errors, their causes, and how to resolve them. It also provides troubleshooting tips for learners, staff, and administrators.

***

#### **1. Error Handling in the System**

The system handles errors at two levels:

1. **Frontend Validation**: Ensures that users provide all necessary inputs before submitting forms.
2. **Backend Validation**: Prevents invalid data, duplicates, and other potential issues during database operations.

**1.1. Common Features of Error Handling**

* **Real-Time Feedback**:
  * Users are notified immediately of errors, such as missing inputs or invalid selections.
* **Detailed Error Messages**:
  * Error messages explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
* **Graceful Failures**:
  * The system prevents operations that could compromise data integrity, such as duplicate registrations or incomplete records.
* **Logging**:
  * Errors encountered during backend operations are logged in Salesforce for debugging and audit purposes.

#### **2. Common Errors and Resolutions**

**2.1. Learner Registration Errors**

| **Error Message**                      | **Cause**                                         | **Resolution**                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _"Please enter the learner's name."_   | Learner Name field is empty.                      | Ensure the **Learner Name** field is filled.                      |
| _"Please select a registration date."_ | Registration Date field is not selected.          | Use the date picker to select a valid registration date.          |
| _"Please select at least one course."_ | No courses selected in the dual-listbox.          | Move at least one course to the **Selected Courses** list.        |
| _"Duplicate registration detected."_   | The learner is already registered for the course. | Ensure the learner hasn’t already registered for the same course. |

**2.2. Enrollment Monitor Errors**

| **Error Message**                    | **Cause**                                       | **Resolution**                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _"No courses available."_            | No active courses are available in `Course__c`. | Check that there are active courses in the database.                                |
| _"Unable to fetch learner details."_ | Backend error while retrieving learner data.    | Ensure the selected course has enrolled learners. Verify Apex method functionality. |
| _"Data unavailable at this time."_   | Connectivity or server issues.                  | Refresh the page or try again later. Check Salesforce logs for backend errors.      |

#### **3. Troubleshooting Tips**

**3.1. For Learners**

1. **Form Submission Issues**:
   * Double-check that all required fields are filled correctly.
   * Ensure that you’ve selected at least one course.
2. **Duplicate Registrations**:
   * If you receive a duplicate registration error, contact support to verify your existing registrations.

**3.2. For Staff**

1. **Enrollment Monitor Issues**:
   * If no courses are displayed, ensure that there are active `Course__c` records.
   * Check for backend errors by reviewing the Salesforce debug logs or contacting an administrator.
2. **Learner Detail Retrieval**:
   * If learner details fail to load, verify that the course has registered learners and check the Apex method `getLearnersByCourse`.

**3.3. For Administrators**

1. **Data Issues**:
   * Verify the integrity of `Course__c`, `Learner__c`, and `Registration__c` objects to ensure the data is complete and accurate.
2. **Backend Errors**:
   * Check the Salesforce debug logs for detailed error information.
   * Ensure Apex triggers and methods are deployed and functioning as intended.

#### **4. Debugging Common Issues**

**4.1. Debugging Frontend Errors**

* Use the browser’s developer console to check for JavaScript errors.
* Ensure that all required Lightning Web Components are deployed and available in your Salesforce environment.

**4.2. Debugging Backend Errors**

* Check the Salesforce debug logs for any exceptions or SOQL errors.
* Verify that the Apex methods (`registerCourses`, `getActiveCoursesWithEnrollment`, `getLearnersByCourse`) are deployed correctly and accessible.

**4.3. Debugging Data Issues**

* Run SOQL queries in Salesforce Developer Console to verify the presence and correctness of `Course__c`, `Learner__c`, and `Registration__c` data.
* Ensure that `PreventDuplicateRegistrations.trigger` is active and functioning as expected.

***

#### **5. Preventive Measures**

1. **Validation Rules**:
   * Implement additional validation rules on Salesforce objects to ensure data integrity.
2. **Testing**:
   * Perform regular testing of the registration form and enrollment monitor in a sandbox environment to catch issues early.
3. **Monitoring**:
   * Use Salesforce monitoring tools to track errors and system performance.

#### **6. Summary**

The **Course Enrollment and Monitoring System** is equipped with robust error handling to ensure smooth operation and data integrity. By following the troubleshooting tips and resolutions outlined above, users and administrators can quickly address and resolve common issues. For persistent errors, refer to Salesforce debug logs or contact support.
