#### **2. Metrics**

The system tracks several important metrics to measure its performance and impact:

**2.1. Registration Metrics**

* **Total Registrations**:
  * The total number of registrations created in a given period.
* **Average Registration Time**:
  * The average time taken by learners to complete the registration process.
* **Error Rate**:
  * The percentage of failed registration attempts due to validation errors.
* **Duplicate Prevention Success**:
  * The number of duplicate registrations successfully blocked by the system.

**2.2. Enrollment Metrics**

* **Total Enrollment Count**:
  * The total number of learners enrolled across all active courses.
* **Enrollment Distribution**:
  * A breakdown of enrollment numbers by course, helping identify popular and under-enrolled courses.
* **Real-Time Data Accuracy**:
  * The time it takes for the system to reflect updates in course enrollments.

**2.3. Usage Metrics**

* **Learner Activity**:
  * The number of learners accessing the registration form.
* **Staff Activity**:
  * The number of staff members accessing the enrollment monitor.

**2.4. Performance Metrics**

* **System Response Time**:
  * The time it takes for the system to process and display data (e.g., course lists, learner details).
* **Query Efficiency**:
  * The number of SOQL queries executed within system limits during typical operations.
* **Component Load Time**:
  * The time taken for the registration form and enrollment monitor components to load.
