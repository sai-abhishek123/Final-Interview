# Backend Logic



### **Backend Logic**

The backend logic of the **Course Enrollment and Monitoring System** is built on Salesforce’s Apex framework. It handles critical operations such as course registration, enrollment monitoring, data retrieval, and preventing duplicate registrations. This page outlines the key components of the backend, including Apex classes, methods, and triggers.

***

#### **1. Overview**

The backend is responsible for:

* Validating and processing learner registrations.
* Fetching and managing course and enrollment data.
* Ensuring data integrity by preventing duplicate records.
* Serving as the bridge between the frontend components (Lightning Web Components) and Salesforce data.

The backend logic is implemented through:

1. **Apex Classes**: `RegistrationService.cls` and `CourseEnrollmentMonitorController.cls`.
2. **Apex Trigger**: `PreventDuplicateRegistrations.trigger`.

***

#### **2. Apex Classes**

**2.1. RegistrationService.cls**

The `RegistrationService` class handles the business logic for learner registration. It ensures that:

* Learners can register for one or more courses at a time.
* Duplicate registrations are prevented.
* Active courses are dynamically fetched and presented to learners.

**Key Methods**

* **`getActiveCourses()`**:
  * Fetches a list of active courses from the `Course__c` custom object.
  * Used by the registration form to populate the list of available courses.
* **`registerCourses(String learnerName, List<Id> courseIds, Date registrationDate)`**:
  * Processes learner registration.
  * Checks if the learner is already registered for the selected courses.
  * Creates new `Registration__c` records linking learners to courses.

***

**2.2. CourseEnrollmentMonitorController.cls**

The `CourseEnrollmentMonitorController` class handles data retrieval for the enrollment monitor. It enables academic staff to view course enrollments and learner details in real time.

**Key Methods**

* **`getActiveCoursesWithEnrollment()`**:
  * Retrieves a list of active courses along with the number of enrolled learners.
  * Aggregates data by counting related `Registration__c` records for each course where the status is `Enrolled`.
* **`getLearnersByCourse(Id courseId)`**:
  * Fetches detailed information about learners enrolled in a specific course.
  * Returns learner names, emails, and registration dates.

***

#### **3. Apex Trigger**

**PreventDuplicateRegistrations.trigger**

This trigger ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate `Registration__c` records. It is triggered whenever a new registration record is created and performs the following:

* Checks if a `Registration__c` record with the same learner and course already exists.
* Prevents the insertion of duplicate records by throwing an error.

**Trigger Execution Flow**

1. Before Insert:
   * Queries existing `Registration__c` records to check for duplicates.
   * If a duplicate is found, the trigger aborts the operation and provides an error message.
2. Before Update:
   * Ensures that existing registrations cannot be updated in a way that creates duplicates.

***

#### **4. Data Flow**

The backend logic interacts with the following custom Salesforce objects:

* **Course\_\_c**:
  * Stores course details, such as course name, description, and status (active/inactive).
* **Learner\_\_c**:
  * Stores learner details, such as name and email.
* **Registration\_\_c**:
  * Links learners to courses and tracks registration details, such as registration date and status.

**Data Flow Example**

1. **Registration Process**:
   * The registration form sends learner and course data to the `registerCourses` method in `RegistrationService`.
   * The method checks for duplicates and creates `Registration__c` records for valid registrations.
2. **Enrollment Monitoring**:
   * The enrollment monitor fetches course and enrollment data using `getActiveCoursesWithEnrollment`.
   * Detailed learner information is retrieved on demand using `getLearnersByCourse`.

***

#### **5. Key Features of Backend Logic**

1. **Validation**:
   * Ensures that required data (e.g., learner name, registration date, selected courses) is provided.
   * Prevents duplicate registrations through the trigger.
2. **Real-Time Data Retrieval**:
   * Provides up-to-date course and enrollment information using Apex methods.
   * Supports dynamic user interfaces that respond to real-time data changes.
3. **Scalability**:
   * Designed to handle multiple courses and registrations efficiently.
   * Uses optimized SOQL queries to fetch data.
4. **Error Handling**:
   * Returns detailed error messages to the frontend for improved user experience.
   * Logs errors in Salesforce for debugging and analysis.

***

#### **6. Example Use Cases**

**6.1. Learner Registration**

When a learner submits the registration form:

1. The frontend calls `registerCourses` with the learner’s details and selected courses.
2. The backend validates the data, checks for duplicates, and creates the appropriate `Registration__c` records.
3. The frontend displays a success message if the operation is successful or an error message if an issue occurs.

**6.2. Enrollment Monitoring**

When a staff member accesses the enrollment monitor:

1. The frontend calls `getActiveCoursesWithEnrollment` to fetch a list of active courses and their enrollment counts.
2. If the staff member clicks "View Learners," the frontend calls `getLearnersByCourse` to retrieve detailed learner information for the selected course.

***

#### **7. Future Enhancements**

* **Support for Additional Course Types**:
  * Extend functionality to include inactive or waitlisted courses.
* **Bulk Registration Support**:
  * Enable batch processing for large-scale registrations.
* **Enhanced Reporting**:
  * Provide advanced analytics on course enrollments and learner demographics.

***

#### **8. Summary**

The backend logic is the backbone of the **Course Enrollment and Monitoring System**, ensuring robust data validation, seamless communication between the frontend and Salesforce objects, and a smooth user experience for both learners and academic staff. By leveraging Salesforce Apex and triggers, the system achieves high efficiency and reliability while maintaining data integrity.
