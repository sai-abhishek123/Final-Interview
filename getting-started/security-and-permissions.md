# Security and Permissions

### **Security and Permissions**

Ensuring robust security and proper access control is crucial for the **Course Enrollment and Monitoring System**. This section outlines the security measures, required permissions, and best practices for safeguarding data and controlling user access.

***

#### **1. Overview**

The system is designed with Salesforce’s robust security model, leveraging object-level, field-level, and record-level permissions to ensure that users can only access the data and functionality they are authorized to use.

***

#### **2. Key Security Features**

1. **Data Integrity**:
   * Prevents duplicate registrations using triggers.
   * Validates data at both the frontend and backend to ensure consistency.
2. **Access Control**:
   * Uses Salesforce profiles, permission sets, and sharing rules to manage user access to objects, fields, and records.
3. **Encryption**:
   * Ensures secure communication between the frontend and backend components.
   * Data is stored securely within Salesforce, leveraging its built-in encryption mechanisms.
4. **Error Handling**:
   * Prevents unauthorized access by validating all requests at the backend.
   * Provides user-friendly error messages without exposing sensitive system details.

***

#### **3. User Roles and Permissions**

The system involves two primary user groups: **Learners** and **Staff**. Each group requires specific permissions to perform their respective tasks.

**3.1. Learners**

* **Responsibilities**:
  * Access the registration form.
  * Submit their details and register for courses.
* **Required Permissions**:
  * **Object Access**:
    * **Course\_\_c**: Read access to view active courses.
    * **Registration\_\_c**: Create access to submit registrations.
  * **Field Access**:
    * Ensure that fields like `Name`, `Registration Date`, and `Selected Courses` are visible and editable.

**3.2. Staff**

* **Responsibilities**:
  * Monitor course enrollments.
  * View detailed learner information.
* **Required Permissions**:
  * **Object Access**:
    * **Course\_\_c**: Read access to view active courses.
    * **Registration\_\_c**: Read access to view registrations.
    * **Learner\_\_c**: Read access to view learner details.
  * **Field Access**:
    * Ensure access to fields such as course names, learner names, emails, and registration dates.

**3.3. Administrators**

* **Responsibilities**:
  * Manage system setup, data, and configurations.
  * Debug issues and resolve errors.
* **Required Permissions**:
  * **Object Access**:
    * Full access to `Course__c`, `Learner__c`, and `Registration__c` objects.
  * **System Access**:
    * Deploy Apex classes, triggers, and Lightning Web Components.
    * Access Salesforce debug logs and developer console for troubleshooting.

***

#### **4. Object-Level Permissions**

The following table outlines the recommended object-level permissions for each user group:

| **Object**            | **Learners** | **Staff** | **Administrators** |
| --------------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| **Course\_\_c**       | Read         | Read      | Full Access        |
| **Registration\_\_c** | Create       | Read      | Full Access        |
| **Learner\_\_c**      | None         | Read      | Full Access        |

***

#### **5. Field-Level Security**

Ensure that sensitive fields are restricted based on the user's role. For example:

* Learners should only have access to fields required for registration.
* Staff should only have access to fields necessary for enrollment monitoring.
* Administrators should have full access to all fields for troubleshooting and configuration.

***

#### **6. Record-Level Security**

**Sharing Rules**

* **Course\_\_c**:
  * Sharing rules can be used to grant staff access to active courses only.
* **Registration\_\_c**:
  * Registrations can be shared with staff based on the course they are associated with.

**Manual Sharing**

* In cases where specific staff need access to a restricted record, manual sharing can be used.

***

#### **7. Security for Lightning Web Components**

1. **Frontend Security**:
   * Use `@wire` methods to fetch only the data the user has permission to access.
   * Validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
   * Avoid exposing sensitive data in the client-side JavaScript.
2. **Backend Security**:
   * Implement field- and object-level checks in Apex methods.
   * Use `with sharing` in Apex classes to enforce sharing rules.

***

#### **8. Best Practices for Security**

1. **Use Profiles and Permission Sets**:
   * Assign granular permissions to users using Salesforce profiles and permission sets.
   * Avoid granting unnecessary object or field access to users.
2. **Enable Debug Logs**:
   * Monitor system behavior by enabling debug logs for administrators during troubleshooting.
3. **Conduct Regular Security Audits**:
   * Periodically review user access, sharing rules, and system configurations to ensure compliance with security standards.
4. **Restrict Data Visibility**:
   * Use role hierarchies, sharing rules, and manual sharing to limit data visibility to only what is required for a user’s role.
5. **Test Permissions in a Sandbox**:
   * Validate user permissions and access scenarios in a sandbox environment before deploying to production.

***

#### **9. Troubleshooting Security Issues**

1. **Learner Cannot See Courses**:
   * Check if the learner has `Read` access to the `Course__c` object and its required fields.
   * Verify that there are active courses available.
2. **Staff Cannot Access Learner Details**:
   * Ensure the staff user has `Read` access to the `Learner__c` and `Registration__c` objects.
   * Check sharing rules for learner and registration records.
3. **Error During Registration Submission**:
   * Verify that the learner has `Create` access to the `Registration__c` object.
   * Check for field-level security restrictions on the required fields.
4. **Access Denied Errors in Apex Methods**:
   * Ensure that Apex methods are enforcing the appropriate sharing settings.
   * Verify that the user has permissions for all objects and fields referenced in the method.

***

#### **10. Summary**

By leveraging Salesforce’s security model, the **Course Enrollment and Monitoring System** ensures that data is secure and access is properly controlled. Following the outlined security configurations and best practices will help maintain system integrity while providing a seamless experience for learners and staff.
