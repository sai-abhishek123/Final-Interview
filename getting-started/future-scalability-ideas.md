# Future Scalability Ideas

### **Future Scalability Ideas**

To ensure the **Course Enrollment and Monitoring System** evolves to meet future requirements, the following scalability ideas and enhancements are proposed. These improvements will enhance data security, streamline user interactions, and comply with privacy regulations such as FERPA.

***

#### **1. FERPA Compliance: Parent-Child Relationships**

To comply with the **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)**, the following enhancements are proposed:

**1.1. Create a `Parent__c` Object**

* **Description**: Introduce a new custom object called `Parent__c` to represent parents or guardians associated with learners.
* **Relationship**: Define a **Master-Detail Relationship** between `Parent__c` (child) and `Learner__c` (master).
* **Purpose**: Allows a parent to view only the learner records they are explicitly associated with.

**1.2. Add a `FERPA__c` Checkbox Field**

* **Location**: Add this field to the `Learner__c` object.
* **Purpose**:
  * When enabled (`FERPA__c = true`), the system enforces stricter privacy controls.
  * Only allows a parent (`Parent__c`) to be attached to the learner.
  * Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the learner's records.

**1.3. Implementation Details**

* **UI Enhancements**:
  * Update the **Learner Detail Page** to allow selecting a parent only if the FERPA checkbox is checked.
  * Add validation rules to enforce FERPA compliance during record updates.
* **Backend Logic**:
  * Apex triggers or validations to ensure:
    * A parent is only associated with learners if FERPA is enabled.
    * Unauthorized users cannot access learner data.
* **Sharing Rules**:
  * Use Salesforce sharing rules to limit access to learner records based on the parent relationship.

**1.4. Use Case**

* A parent logs into the system and can view only the records of the learners they are assigned to. For example:
  * If FERPA is enabled for a learner, a parent linked to that learner can access their details but cannot view other learner records.

***

#### **2. Multi-Course Registration Form: Auto-Populated Learner Name**

To improve usability and prevent errors, the **Registration Form** should be enhanced to auto-populate the learner's name if they are signed in.

**2.1. Auto-Population of Learner Name**

* **Description**:
  * When a signed-in learner accesses the registration form, their name should be fetched dynamically from the `Learner__c` object and displayed in the **Learner Name** field.
  * The name should be **non-editable** to prevent accidental or unauthorized changes.
* **Implementation Details**:
  * **Frontend**:
    * Use an Apex method to fetch the signed-in learner’s name and pre-fill the field on form load.
    * Disable the input field to make it read-only.
  * **Backend**:
    * Create an Apex method to fetch the learner’s name based on the signed-in user’s context.
    * Use Salesforce’s User and Learner object relationship to identify the current learner.
* **Error Handling**:
  * If no learner is associated with the signed-in user, display a message and prevent form submission.

**2.2. Benefits**

* Enhances usability by reducing manual input.
* Improves data accuracy by ensuring the learner name matches the signed-in user.
* Complies with best practices for form design by minimizing user error.

**2.3. Use Case**

* A learner logs into the system and navigates to the registration form. Their name is automatically displayed in the **Learner Name** field, ensuring a seamless and error-free experience.

#### **3. Additional Scalability Enhancements**

**3.1. Role-Based Access Control**

* Enhance the system’s security model by assigning roles (e.g., `Admin`, `Staff`, `Parent`, `Learner`) with specific permissions.
* Implement dynamic UI changes based on the user’s role (e.g., hide staff-specific features for learners).

**3.2. Expanded Course Metrics**

* Add advanced analytics to monitor course popularity, learner engagement, and registration trends.
* Provide visual dashboards for staff to quickly assess course performance.

**3.3. Bulk Registration Support**

* Allow academic staff to register multiple learners for a course in one operation.
* Add a bulk upload feature with CSV support.

**3.4. Waitlist Management**

* Add a waitlist feature for courses nearing capacity.
* Notify learners automatically when spots become available.

**3.5. Integration with External Systems**

* Enable integration with third-party learning management systems (LMS) for better data sharing and analytics.
* Use Salesforce APIs to sync learner and course data with external platforms.

**3.6. Enhanced Learner Portal**

* Create a dedicated portal for learners to view their registered courses, track progress, and access course materials.

***

#### **4. Benefits of Proposed Enhancements**

* **Privacy Compliance**:
  * Ensures the system adheres to FERPA regulations by limiting access to sensitive learner data.
* **Improved User Experience**:
  * Auto-populating learner names and restricting unauthorized edits enhance usability.
* **Operational Efficiency**:
  * Role-based access control and bulk registration streamline workflows for staff and administrators.
* **Scalability**:
  * New features such as waitlist management and analytics prepare the system for future growth.

***

#### **5. Summary**

These proposed enhancements aim to ensure the **Course Enrollment and Monitoring System** remains robust, secure, and user-friendly while complying with privacy regulations like FERPA. By implementing these ideas, the system can scale effectively to meet future demands, enhance usability, and provide a seamless experience for all users.
